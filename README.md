# Right/Left Hand Rule Game
## How To Play
At the start of the game, a particle (positive or negative) will move downwards and stop just before entering the magnetic field (out or into the page). From there the user must use the right hand or left hand rule to determine which direction the particle will go before the timer on the left runs out. 

If the user answers correctly the particle will move in that direction and you will get 1 point added to your score and time added to the timer. As you progress through the levels, this time added will decrease. 

If the user answers incorrectly, the particle will not move and you will lose a life.

The user will also lose a life if they do not give an answer before time runs out. 

Once the user lose all three of their lives, the game ends. They will be taken to a screen where they will see their score and have the option to play again or be taken back to the main menu.
